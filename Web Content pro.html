        <p>
            <em>Wastewater from a community is commonly known as</em> <strong>Sewage</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wastewater from toilets or actions like draining kitchen sinks can be included in household (or other buildings) wastewater.<br>
Using excessive amounts of water is a simple task for anyone.
Damaged chemicals or cleaning products can be drained through your pipes when sewage and wastewater are being drained from your pipes ,It's possible that you're using your
 sewage system too frequently, or it's always possible that a large amount of water treatment is required. Wastewater services are being managed poorly by companies to protect the environment.

        <h2>Information About Sewage</h2>
        <p>Sewage is the wastewater, discharged from residence , commertial establishment, and industrial facilities. </p>
        <h3>Types of Sewage</h3>
    <h4>Domestic Sewage:</h4>
        <p>This is the wastewater generated from household and appartment . It is also known as <strong>Sanitary Sewage</strong></p>
    <h4>Industrial Sewage:</h4>
        <p>This is the wastage generated from manufacturing or chemical process. It may contain a variety of pollutant such as heavy metal, toxic chemicals, oil and grease</p>
    <h4>Storm Sewage:</h4> 
        <p>Storm sewage is the runoff from the precipitation that is collected in a system of pipes or open channels.</p>
    <h3>Composition of Sewage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water ( 99.9% )</li>
        <li>Human Excreta</li>
        <li>Food Waste</li>
        <li>Laundary Waterwaste</li>
        <li>Oil and grease</li>
        <li>Heavy metals</li>
        <li>Toxic chemicals</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 style="color: aqua;">Impact of Waterwastage</h2>
        <p>Water wastage can have a significant negative impact on the environment and human health if it is not properly treated.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Some of the potential impacts of Waterwastage:</strong></p>
    <h4>Water Pollution:</h4>
        <p>Waste water can pollute rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater with bacteria, viruses, chemical and heavy metals.
             This can make the water unsafe for drinking, swimming , fishing, and other activities.</p>
    <h4>Europhication:</h4>
        <p>Waste water can contain high level of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients can cause Europhication. 
            Which is a process that leads to excessive algae growth in water bodies. Europhication can deplete oxygen level in water,
             which can kill fish and other aquatic lives.</p>
    <h4>Spread of Diseases:</h4>
        <p>Waste water can contain pathogens that can cause diseases such as cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. These disease can spread 
            through contact with contaminated water or food.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dispose">
       <h2>Method TO Despose Water Waste</h2> 
    <h4>Sewage Treatment Plant ( STP ) :</h4>
       <p>A Sewage Treatment Plant collects wastewater and treats it to remove pollutants. The treated water then discharged into
         a water body such as a river or lake, or reused for irrigation or other purposes.</p>
    <h4>Septic Tank:</h4>
       <p>It is a buried, watertight tank that collects and treats wastewater from house and business. The waste water 
          flows into the tank and separate into these layers: Solids, Scum, and effluent. The solid and scum are broken down by bacteria
           and effluent flows out of the tank and into a drain field, where it is further treated by the soil.
       </p>
    <h4>Cesspol:</h4>
       <p>It is a hole in the ground that collects and stores wastewater. Cesspol are not as effective at treating wastewater as Septic Tank,
         and they can pollute groundwater.</p>
    <h4>Lagoon</h4>
       <p>It is a large man-made pond that collects and treat wastewater. Lagoons are natural process such as Sunlight and algae, to break pollutants in the wastewater.</p>
    <h4>Land Application</h4>
       <p>It is a method of disposing wastewater by spraying it on land. The wastewater is treated by the soil and plants, and it can be used to irrigate crops or fertilize land.</p>

        <h2>Wastewater Treatment</h2>
        <p>Wastewater treatment involves a series of processes to remove contaminants and make the water safe for disposal or reuse.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fix any leaks in your faucet or pipes. Even a small leak can waste a lot of water.</li>
        <li>Take shorter showers. A five minute shower uses about 25 gallons of water, while a 10 minute shower uses about 50 gallons of water.</li>
        <li>Turn off the faucet while you brush your teeth or shave.</li>
        <li>Only flush the toilet when necessary.</li>
        <li>Water your lawn and garden less often.</li>
        <li>Install water-efficient appliances.</li>
        <li>Collect rainwater to use for watering plants or washing your cars and other uses.</li>
        <li>Use a broom instead of hose to clean your driveway or sidewalk.</li>
    </ol>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Water is a significant source on earth. It is essential for life and supports all ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Water is a universal solvent , meaning it can dissolve many different substances. This make it important for many industrial and agricultural processes.</li>
            <li>Our website will educate people how to use water judiciously without affecting nature. This means using water efficiently and avoiding wastful practices.</li>
            <li>It is important for our government to provide facilities and infrastructure to support water consevation efforts. This include things like 
                <strong>Water Treatment Plants, Water Recycling Programs and Public Education Campaigns.</strong></li>
            <li>We all have a reponsibility to prevent water pollution and manage wastewater.</li>
            <li>Water waste is a serious problem, but it is one that we should solve. By making simple changes in our daily lives and supporting government and bussiness efforts to conserve water,
                we can reduce waste of water and protect our precious water resourse.
